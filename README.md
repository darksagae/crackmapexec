# crackmapexec
**CrackMapExec** (CME) is a popular post-exploitation tool used in penetration testing to simplify the process of attacking and managing Windows systems on a network. It is especially useful for executing commands, performing pass-the-hash attacks, and gathering information.

### Installation

CrackMapExec is typically included in Kali Linux. If itâ€™s not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install crackmapexec
```

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for using CrackMapExec is:

```bash
crackmapexec <protocol> <target> [options]
```

### Common Protocols

- **smb**: Windows SMB protocol
- **winrm**: Windows Remote Management

### Common Options

- **-u <username>**: Specify a username.
- **-p <password>**: Specify a password.
- **-d <domain>**: Specify a domain.
- **-x <command>**: Execute a command on the target.
- **--shares**: List shares on the target.

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Checking SMB Access

To check if you can access a target using SMB:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p password123
```

**Expected Output:**
```
SMB         192.168.1.100    445    Administrator:password123    [*] Logged in!
```

#### 2. Executing a Command Remotely

To execute a command on a target:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p password123 -x "ipconfig"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[*] 192.168.1.100: SMB         Administrator:password123    [*] Command output:
...
```

#### 3. Listing Shares on a Target

To list the shares available on a target system:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p password123 --shares
```

**Expected Output:**
```
SMB         192.168.1.100    445    Administrator:password123    [*] Shares
[*]     Share Name           Type
[*]     -----------          ----
[*]     C$                   Disk
[*]     IPC$                 Disk
```

#### 4. Performing a Pass-the-Hash Attack

To perform a pass-the-hash attack using a hash instead of a password:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u Administrator -p '$HASH'
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[*] 192.168.1.100: SMB         Administrator:$HASH    [*] Logged in!
```

### Important Considerations

- **Legal Use**: Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you are targeting. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
- **Network Conditions**: The effectiveness of CrackMapExec can vary based on network configurations and security settings.

### Conclusion

CrackMapExec is a powerful tool for network penetration testing, enabling you to manage and exploit Windows systems efficiently. By understanding its syntax and options, you can effectively assess the security of your network. Always use this tool responsibly and within the legal framework.

                         ALTERNATIVE
CrackMapExec (CME) is a post-exploitation tool used for assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. It is often described as a "Swiss army knife" for penetration testing Windows/Active Directory environments. CrackMapExec is designed to be stealthy, and it leverages built-in Active Directory features and protocols to achieve its functionality, which helps it evade endpoint protection and intrusion detection systems.

### Installation

CrackMapExec is available in Kali Linux. To install it, you may use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install crackmapexec
```

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax for using CrackMapExec is:

```bash
crackmapexec <protocol> <target(s)> [options]
```

`<protocol>`: Specifies the protocol to use (e.g., `smb`, `ssh`, `winrm`).
`<target(s)>`: Specifies the target IP address, hostname, or a file containing a list of targets.
`[options]`: Specifies various options depending on the module being used.

### Common Protocols

*   **smb**: For interacting with SMB/CIFS services.
*   **ssh**: For interacting with SSH services.
*   **winrm**: For interacting with WinRM services.

### Examples

#### 1. Enumerating SMB shares

To enumerate SMB shares on a target machine, you can use the following command:

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u <username> -p <password> --shares
```

This command attempts to authenticate to the target using the provided username and password and then lists the available SMB shares.

#### 2. Retrieving the target's password policy

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u <username> -p <password> --pass-pol
```

This command retrieves the password policy of the target machine.

#### 3. Executing a command on a remote host

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u <username> -p <password> -x "whoami"
```

This command executes the `whoami` command on the target machine via SMB.

#### 4. Dumping SAM hashes

```bash
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.100 -u <username> -p <password> --sam
```

This command dumps the SAM hashes from the target system after a successful login.

### Important Considerations

*   **Legal Use**: Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you are targeting. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
*   **Credentials**: You need valid credentials to perform most actions with CrackMapExec.
*   **Modules**: CrackMapExec has a modular design, allowing you to load and use different modules for various tasks.
